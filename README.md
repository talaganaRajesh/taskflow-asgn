# TaskFlow - Personal Task Tracker


## 📖 Description

**TaskFlow** is a sleek, modern personal task management application developed as part of the RYGNeco Web Development Internship assignment. Inspired by premium corporate UIs like Google Workspace and Microsoft 365, it offers an intuitive experience with a simple login, robust task management, and a responsive interface. The app defaults to a light theme with a soft white background and includes a pure black dark mode toggle for enhanced usability. Built with React and Vite, styled with Tailwind CSS, and powered by `localStorage` for persistence, TaskFlow stands out with bonus features like search functionality and dark mode, demonstrating initiative and attention to detail.

## 📝 Notes

### Design Philosophy  
TaskFlow features a premium, corporate-inspired design with a unique "TaskFlow" branding, highlighted by an orange accent color and smooth animations. The light theme uses soft grays, while the dark theme is pure black for a striking contrast.

### Bonus Features  
The inclusion of search and dark mode reflects initiative, aligning with the assignment's encouragement for extra effort.


### Testing  
The application has been rigorously tested for edge cases (e.g., empty inputs, no tasks, persistence across refreshes) and performs well on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

### Challenges Overcome  
Successfully resolved an initial issue with task persistence on refresh by initializing state with localStorage data and correcting default values.

### Future Improvements  
Potential enhancements include task priorities, due dates, or integration with a backend API for multi-device support (post-internship).
